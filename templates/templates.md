# Templates
Below are listed included templates designed to aid the researcher in preparing surveys for execution on Qualtrics and MTurk. A variety of templates are offered: from `HTML` templates for specifying MTurk HITs, and survey templates containing simple demographic-question sets; to design-specific Qualtrics templates (e.g., including JavaScript code for conjoint analysis).


## Qualtrics templates
Qualtrics templates are provided in both `.qsf` and `.pdf` formats. `.pdf` files depict questions as they appear to the subject, whereas `.qsf` files may be used to import the actual questions into Qualtrics, en masse.
